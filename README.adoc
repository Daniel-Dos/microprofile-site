== Live demo application

Checkout the demo application here: http://ec2-54-209-191-237.compute-1.amazonaws.com/microprofile

Changes in this source code will automatically update the demo application.

== How to build and run the application locally?

Simply run `mvn clean install tomee:run`. Your server will be available at
http://localhost:8080/

If you want to the GitHub integration to work, you will need a microprofile github access token, (link:https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens[Documentation on how to do this]). Set the `microprofile_github_atoken` value in `src/main/resources/base.properties`.  When you generate that token Github will present you with a list of 20+ possible permissions.  The only required permission is `read:org`.

Currently you can ignore the twitter integration tokens, they are not feature complete (and should probably be in a seperate code branch).

If you are making changes to the https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile.io[microprofile.io] configuration repo, you can test that by having your local copy point to your forked version where the changes live.  Simply edit `src/main/resources/base.properties` and change the default `microprofile_config_root=microprofile/microprofile.io` to the individual's repo who filed the `microprofile.io` pull request.  For example `microprofile_config_root=ivannov/microprofile.io` is how you would point to https://github.com/ivannov/microprofile.io

== Node.js and Gulp

This application heavily depends on link:https://nodejs.org/[node.js] and link:http://gulpjs.com/[gulp] to build all the
static resources. These tools will execute tons of actions not yet available in the java world; at least not as handy
as available on node.js. The good news is that we don't need to worry about a thing. It will feel like any regular
maven project. `mvn clean install tomee:run` will perform all the heavy lifting. It downloads the dependencies
and executes node.js, gulp and the tomee server.

== What about front-end development?

Front-end developers don't need to restart servers. In fact, front-end developers don't like to waste a single second
waiting for a JS change to be reflected on a web application. This is what make web development fun.

Our application uses
link:http://jade-lang.com/[Jade],
link:http://sass-lang.com/[Sass],
link:https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer[Autoprefixer],
link:https://github.com/sprity/sprity[Sprity],
link:http://bower.io/[Bower],
link:https://github.com/karimsa/gulp-jslint[JsLint],
link:https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify[UglifyJs],
link:https://github.com/floridoo/gulp-sourcemaps[SourceMaps]. Obviously, we have a lot of work to do before making a
static change visible in the web site.

In order to make it automatic, run `mvn frontend:gulp` in another terminal. It will trigger the default gulp task,
which will watch for changes on *src/main/static/* and updates the running tomee instance accordingly as soon as a
static change is detected.

== Unit testing

We have two types of tests: backend and frontend. The frontend testing
is somewhat special because it uses link:http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html[karma]. It's transparent for
the devepolers because both tests are triggered by the same `mvn clean install`.

Sometimes we are interested on frontend testing only. We can do it by executing 'mvn frontend:karma'.

The default browser is PhantomJS. In order to debug with the help of a real browser, uncomment this line in

When you execute `mvn frontend:karma`, a browser window will popup.

== TODO OUT OF DATE - How to publish content?

Some of the content of this application is based on another Github project: link:https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile.io.config[].

The files under link:https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile.io.config/tree/master/specs[] configure the projects
listed on link:http://ec2-54-174-245-236.compute-1.amazonaws.com/microprofile/docs[].

This file - link:https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile.io.config/blob/master/pages/microprofile.adoc[] - is the
one that is shown in the home page - link:http://ec2-54-174-245-236.compute-1.amazonaws.com/microprofile/[]. The other
files go to the `page` route. For example, link:https://github.com/jcpevangelists/microprofile.io.config/blob/master/pages/page_a.adoc[]
goes to link:http://ec2-54-174-245-236.compute-1.amazonaws.com/microprofile/page/page_a.adoc[].

Updates on link:https://github.com/microprofile/microprofile.io.config/[] are automatically reflected on the demo site.

== Production Architecture

=== Summary
Clouldflare sits in front of our website as a CDN and proxy. By setting our NS records to point at Cloudflare, Clouldflare automagically handles content distribution around the world by scraping our website. If Cloudflare cannot handle the request, it will hand the request off to the Amazon ELB. The Amazon ELB points at EC2 instances created by an autoscaling group. The isntances are running the Amazon Beanstalk Agent. The autoscaling group maintains a minimum of 1 instance. If the autoscaling group notices the servers are too busy, it'll add instances. When a new instance is launched, the Amazon Beanstalk Agent on the instance notifies the Beanstalk Cluster that it's available to take a task. The Beanstalk Cluster will then deploy the new zip file to the instance, and notify the ELB to start sending traffic to the new instance. The ELB will start sending traffic to the new instance once the instance begins passing health checks.

=== Cloudflare CDN

==== DNS
```
[User Agent] -DNS Query-> [Cloudflare NS]
[User Agent] <-DNS Response to closest Cloudflare server- [Cloudflare NS]
```

==== HTTP
```
[User Agent] -HTTP Request-> [Cloudflare HTTP Servers]
If static asset:
[User Agent] <-HTTP Response- [Cloudflare Cache server]
If non-static asset:
[User Agent] <-HTTP Response- [Cloudflare Proxy server] <-HTTP Response- [Amazon Elastic Load Balancer]
```

==== Amazon Architecture
```
[Elastic Load Balancer] |-> [Active Instances Subnet0] -> [JVM Instance]
                        |-> [Active Instances Subnet1] -> [JVM Instance]
```

== Deployment

The deploy process creates a zip file which has the executable jar, and bundles several AWS config files.

=== Build and deploy manually

**Note** 
Before running this command, one should make sure `microprofile_github_atoken` in `src/main/resources/base.properties` is set to a production value, or should override it using one of the ways afforded by the Sabot project.

`mvn clean package tomee:exec assembly:assembly && eb deploy`

=== Config file descriptions

`src/main/config/haproxy.cfg`

This is a simple HAProxy installation that redirects `www.microprofile.io` to `microprofile.io` This is running on an independent instance in AWS.

`src/main/config/ebextensions`

This directory is filtered and copied to `/.ebextensions` in the root of the assembled ZIP archive. It is not part of the JAR. These files configure the Elastic Beanstalk cluster.

`src/main/config/elasticbeanstalk`

This directory is filtered and copied to `.elasticbeanstalk` in the root the maven project. It is not part of the JAR nor the ZIP. These files configure the deployment process to Elastic Beanstalk.

`src/main/config/ziproot`

This directory is filtered and copied to `/` in the root of the assembled ZIP archive. 

* `Procfile` tells the AWS Agent what command to run to launch your deployment. It launches the next script:
* `kill-before-run.sh` ensures that all existing Java processes have been terminated before launching the new Java archive. This is sort of a hack, if someone has a better way to do this, it'd be much appreciated.
